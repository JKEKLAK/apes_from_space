# apes_from_space

The screen has been made larger, 1024x 576
The battleship is bound to the y axis, but is moved by the mouse for smoother control
there is a live count of monkeys hit (score) and bananas fired (bananas)
the user can pause the game by presseing P and resume by pressing C
there are no difficulty levels
the battleship is bound to one axis
There are 7 unique apes, gorillas monkeys baboons
There is audio for the banana being fired, a monkey being hit, and gameover screen
there is a techno background music that pauses when the game is paused

There is a main menu the preceeds the game, not too complex just the name, credits and "click to begin"
I added 2 different background images, one for main menu and one for game screen.
The game also has its own windows icon of a monkey in a space helmut
